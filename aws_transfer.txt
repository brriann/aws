Migrating users from an existing SFTP server to AWS Transfer.
-can replace default host key with a host key from another server if moving existing users from an existing SFTP server to new AWS SFTP server
  -this prevents users from getting notified to verify authenticity of SFTP server again
  
Creating an IAM role for AWS Transfer Family:

You will need to supply an IAM Role when setting up your user. The role determines what resources (Amazon S3 bucket) you want to allow your user to 
access and which operations they can (and cannot perform). We recommend that you use the role for Amazon S3 bucket selection and file operations management. 
If you want to allocate portions of the bucket to the user for e.g. home directory, we recommend using scope down policy.

All roles used for the service must trust "transfer.amazonaws.com".

An optional IAM "scope down" IAM policy lets you use the same role across multiple users when your users have the same access privileges but to different 
portions of your S3 bucket, e.g., only to their home directory. You can use the following policy variables: [transfer:UserName], [transfer:HomeBucket] 
and [transfer:HomeDirectory] in your IAM policy. When your user authenticates into the service, these variables are replaced with the appropriate values 
for the user. This makes it easier to apply the exact same policy documents to multiple users, reducing the overhead of IAM role and policy management for 
managing your users' access to your Amazon S3 bucket.

Note that these variables may only be used in the scope-down policy, and only for this service. They cannot be used in IAM Policies attached to the user's Role 
or for any other service.

We recommend that you use the policy editor in the IAM Console, save the policy there and select it here.
